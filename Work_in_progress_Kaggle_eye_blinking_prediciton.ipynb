You have to compare the prediction performance of your two best prediction models. This includes data pre-processing, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. I also want you to compare the actual predictions made by each model.\n",
        "To create a new notebook go the \"File\" in the menu bar and click \"New notebook\". Do not forget to save your notebook to your GitHub account. You can create as many notebooks as you want, but the final report should be in a notebook with the name \"Kaggle_eye_blinking_prediciton.ipynb\"\n",
